 *
 * - **Say "no letter here".** Trained with CTC, whose blank class is exactly that. A geometric
 *   table can only rank letters by similarity, so a hand mid-transition between two letters
 *   scores badly everywhere and is indistinguishable from a hand the table simply does not know.
 * - **Use what came before.** A GRU carries hidden state, so this is an automaton rather than a
 *   pure function of one frame — which is why `reset()` exists and why the caller must use it
 *   when a session starts or the hand leaves frame. State carried across a pause describes a
 *   past that is no longer there.
 *
 * The forward pass shares `gruStep` with the vocabulary engine rather than reimplementing it.
