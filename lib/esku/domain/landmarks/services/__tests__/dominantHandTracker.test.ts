/**
 * Which hand is the signing one, when two are visible.
 *
 * `dominantHand` answers with the larger bounding box, and on this corpus that is nearly a
 * coin toss: audited against LSE-FS-UVigo's own `handness` labels it takes the wrong hand in
 * 23.7% of two-hand frames. The cost is far worse than it sounds because the alphabet engine
 * carries hidden state — a wrong hand does not lose one frame, it poisons the GRU's state and
 * the frames after it. Swapping this rule alone cut character error 46% relative.
 *
 * Motion is the signal, accumulated rather than instantaneous, and deliberately not "prefer
 * the right hand": this corpus is 199/200 right-dominant so that prior would score 99% here
 * and fail every left-handed signer — the exact bug this repository already shipped once.
