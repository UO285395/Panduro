 * handful of examples and no training loop, where gradient descent would need far more of
 * both and a much longer wait on a phone. It is also the only engine that works for a sign
 * language we ship no model for — the user supplies the data.
 *
 * A sign scores as its *best* matching example, not its average. Recordings of one sign vary
 * (a hand higher, a beat slower); averaging would punish a sign for having varied examples,
 * which is exactly the variety that makes it robust.
