   * Two opposed pressures. Signs decelerate internally — a two-part sign slows at its hinge —
   * so without a floor near the typical sign length the rule chops signs in half. But the
   * floor also puts short signs out of reach as arithmetic: a window forced to last F can
   * only reach IoU 0.5 against a sign of length L if L >= F/2, and half of real signing is
   * shorter than 480 ms.
   *
   * Which pressure wins depends on the classifier, and it has changed sides. Against the
   * dictionary-only model, 1150 -> 850 cost 8 points of isolated top-1 to buy 3 of continuous
   * recovery, so the floor stayed high. Re-measured on the co-articulated model over the same
   * four seeds, the move buys +6.9 points of continuous word recall at an unchanged gate
   * (34.9% -> 41.9%) for 5.4 of isolated. Shorter windows only pay once the classifier has
   * seen a sign glued to the sign before it; the two levers multiply.
   *
   * Part of that +6.9 is not recall, though: shorter windows also write more into pauses,
   * from 31% of the gaps between annotated sentences to 36%. The shipped pairing raises the
   * window gate to 0.60 to give that back, and banks **+2.3 points at a flat 30%** — see
   * `RecognizeSignsUseCase`, which holds the other half of this decision.

 * `tools/train/sweep.py` replays SWL-LSE's isolated recordings; `tools/train/continuous.py`
 * splices them into unbroken streams and asks how many signs survive. The shipped
 * stillness rule scored 0.739 on the first and **0.146 on the second** — it never closes
 * without a pause, so it only closed at the cap, and with a median sign of 30 frames
 * nearly every 48-frame window straddled a boundary. That is why the app read a signing
 * video and wrote nothing.
 *
 * These settings give 0.696 isolated and 0.384 continuous at higher precision (0.755 against
 * 0.710). Four points of the validated path bought twenty-four of the one people actually
 * use. Note the continuous benchmark splices isolated recordings and so cannot reproduce
 * real co-articulation: read it as an upper bound.
 *
 * **Expressed in time, not frames, and that was a bug for a while.** Every threshold here
 * used to be a frame count, swept against SWL-LSE — which is 20.00 fps in all 300 of its
 * recordings. The live pipeline runs three MediaPipe models per frame and reaches whatever
 * the device allows, so those counts silently meant a different duration on every phone.
 * Below the dataset's rate a sign never reached that 24-frame floor and every window was
 * discarded as too short: measured in a real browser, 23 frames in 16 s, six windows
 * discarded, the vocabulary engine asked **zero** times, nothing written. The same build
 * recognised "Dolor" at 68% as soon as the input was slowed to restore the sampling density.
 * `LandmarkFrame` has always carried `timestampMs`; it just was not read.
 *
 * The values below are the swept frame counts converted at 20.00 fps — and N frames span
 * N-1 intervals, so the old 24-frame floor is 1150 ms, not 1200. Converting exactly is what
 * lets `simulate_app.py` reproduce the pre-conversion scores and prove the port faithful.
 * `minSignMs` is the one value that no longer comes from that sweep: it was re-measured on
 * real continuous signing and lowered to 850, which is 18 frames at the dataset's rate.
