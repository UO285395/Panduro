/**
 * What the trained LSE vocabulary model reads.

 * trained on one layout and fed another does not fail — it predicts noise, quietly.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from `windowSignature`, which describes a *taught* sign. The two
 * used to be one function, and every improvement to this model invalidated every sign the
 * user had recorded. They ship on different clocks, so they get different code.
 *
 * Measured on the held-out test split: hand position relative to the torso (+5.7 top-1),
 * sixteen frames instead of eight (+3.0), torso and head orientation (+0.9 over four seeds).
 * Facial expression is the exception — its published +1.2 was the best of four seeds and its
 * mean is below dropping it, so those six floats have not earned their place. They stay
 * because this corpus is a dictionary of isolated signs and cannot show what the face is for.
 * Motion deltas, raw face coordinates and input augmentation were all measured and all made it
 * worse. `tools/train/README.md` has the seed sweep.
